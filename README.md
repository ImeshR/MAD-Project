## Project Name: Mobile Application for Buy and Sell Books.
## Mobile App Name: KeepIt

### Project Description 

```
Considering the economic crisis currently affecting Sri Lanka, many students are facing financial
difficulties, including the inability to afford educational materials such as textbooks. To address
this issue, we propose the development of a mobile application that facilitates the buying and
selling of used books, with a focus on university and A/L students in Sri Lanka. The application
will include a social login feature for easy registration, as well as options for users to list books
as either free or for sale and purchase books. Users can categorize their listings to help other
users find relevant materials. Users can manage their listings through a dedicated dashboard.
Payment options will be available through an online payment gateway, allowing for seamless
transactions between buyers and sellers.

To enhance the user experience, the application will feature a user-friendly home page that
makes it easy for users to find what they need. Users can add books to their cart. The application
will also include a payment section where users can add and manage their credit or debit cards
and view their payment history. Overall, we believe that this application will be an invaluable
resource for Sri Lankan students looking for affordable educational materials.
